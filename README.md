### Contribution opportunities

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We appreciate all contributions, see the [guidelines for contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details, including information on how to build HTML output from the `source` file so you can preview your changes locally.

### Tests

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tests are in the `html/` directory of the [web-platform-tests repository](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt).

### Blame

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the `source` file is too large for [GitHub's blame utility](https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/), use [blame for `source` on searchfox](https://searchfox.org/whatwg-html/source/source) instead.
